### 🎉 How to Use:

- [x] Clone this `repo`
- [x] remove my remote url by `git remote remove origin`
- [x] run `npm i`
- [x] create a new `repo` on your github dashboard
- [x] add that repo with this project by `git remote add origin`
- [x] run `node index.js` in any unix based terminal

**Note**: If you're using windows, you can run on `git bash` or `wsl`

❤️Happy coding
